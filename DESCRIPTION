Description: The MLMOI package provides the maximum-likelihood estimations of multiplicity of infection (MOI) and lineage (allele) frequencies from molecular data. The package reaches out to scientists that seek to analyze molecular data using these methods. For the users' convenience, data can be entered in various ways as *.xlsx, *.csv, or *.txt files and processed by the functions of this package.
